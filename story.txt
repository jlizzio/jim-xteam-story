Once upon a time there was a man named Alex. Alex was tall with long flowing 
hair. He always loved playing baseball with the other kids from his 
neighborhood when he was younger. Now, Alex is a bank teller in Madison, 
Wisconsin. He lives in a nice apartment with his mother because he takes good
care of her.
