Once upon a time there was a man named Alex. Alex was tall with long flowing 
hair. He always loved playing baseball with the other kids from his 
neighborhood when he was younger. Now, Alex is a bank teller in Madison, 
Wisconsin. He lives in a nice apartment with his mother because he takes good
care of her. 
Alex met a pretty girl called Lucy. Soon they got married and Lucy have a baby. 
When the baby was born, everyone was happy except Alex's mum. She got cancer and 
may die in a year, but she did not told it to Alex.
