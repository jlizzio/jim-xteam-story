Once upon a time there was a man named Alex. Alex was tall with long flowing 
hair. He always loved playing baseball with the other kids from his 
neighborhood when he was younger. Now, Alex is a bank teller in Madison, 
Wisconsin. He lives in a nice apartment with his mother because he takes good
care of her. 
Alex met a pretty girl called Lucy. Soon they got married and Lucy have a baby. 
When the baby was born, everyone was happy except Alex's mum. She got cancer and 
may die in a year, but she did not told it to Alex.
Alex's mom didn't want to tell him, because the doctors told her it's a new form a cancer,
which is contagious, and she wanted to meet her grandbaby. After awhile Alex's mom was
showing signs of being really sick, so Alex confronted her. At first she played it off
and ALex didn't find out, she said it was only a cold. Alex later saw a letter from the
doctor that revealed it all.

Alex was a little angry,but he understand her mom. He took her mum for the doctor, and his mom died in the hospital in a few months.
The story of Alex is not stopped even though he is really sad. His baby, Cindy, is going to celebrate her first birthday.

During the birthday, the cake fell on the ground, Cindy started to cry. This 
caused Alex to go into a panic. Alex rushed to another bakery 10 minutes 
away and got a better cake. This cake was double the size with two layers and 
a princess ontop. Cindy was happy again, feeling better than ever.

In the end of the day, although Alex lost his mom, they had many photos and videos of all of the happpy memories
that they shared together. This first birthday was a bittersweet day because Alex's mom was not there, 
however, they all continued to live their lives together and happy.
